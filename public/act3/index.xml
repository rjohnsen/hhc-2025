    <title>Act 3 :: SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/act3/index.html</link>
    <description>Act 3 – Integration, Depth, and Decision-Making Act 3 emphasizes depth, ambiguity, and integration of skills developed earlier. The challenges require comfort with uncertainty, careful reading of instructions, and deliberate sequencing of actions across hardware, software, and application layers. Mistakes are more costly, and brute force approaches are actively punished. This act aligns closely with real-world incidents and complex assessments, where success depends on restraint, planning, and understanding when not to act.</description>

Thomas Bouve mission statement Hi there, I’m Thomas, but you can call me CraHan if you like.&#xA;What do you mean ‘weird accent’? I have no idea why people keep telling me that, but it sounds fine in my head, to be honest.</description>

      <description>Objective Difficulty Description 3/5 Kevin in the Retro Store ponders pentest paradoxes—can you solve Schrödinger’s Scope? Kevin McFarland mission statement The Neighborhood College Course Registration System has been getting some updates lately and I’m wondering if you might help me improve its security by performing a small web application penetration test of the site.&#xA;For any web application test, one of the most important things for the test is the ‘scope’, that is, what one is permitted to test and what one should not. While hacking is fun and cool, professional integrity means respecting scope boundaries, especially when there are tempting targets outside our permitted scope.</description>

      <title>Find and Shutdown Frostys Snowglobe Machine</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/act3/find-and-shutdown-frostys-snowglobe-machine/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:59:59 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/act3/find-and-shutdown-frostys-snowglobe-machine/index.html</guid>
      <description>Objective Difficulty Description 3/5 You’ve heard murmurings around the city about a wise, elderly gnome having a change of heart. He must have information about where Frosty’s Snowglobe Machine is. You should find and talk to the gnome so you can get some help with how to make your way through the Data Center’s labrynthian halls. Once you find the Snowglobe Machine, figure out how to shut it down and melt Frosty’s cold, nefarious plans. Solution This objective blends narrative exploration with problem-solving by requiring me to gather contextual clues before taking technical action. Rather than immediately interacting with the Snowglobe Machine, I first had to locate and engage an NPC who provided critical guidance on navigating the Data Center environment. The challenge reinforces that effective incident response and disruption often depend on information gathering and situational awareness before execution, mirroring how intelligence and access paths are established prior to shutting down malicious infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Objective Difficulty Description 4/5 Help Evan next to city hall hack this gnome and retrieve the temperature value reported by the I²C device at address 0x3C. The temperature data is XOR-encrypted, so you’ll need to work through each communication stage to uncover the necessary keys. Start with the unencrypted data being transmitted over the 1-wire protocol. Evan Booth mission statement Hey, I’m Evan!</description>

Goose Olivia mission statement “HONK! Well hello there! Fancy meeting you here in the Dosis Neighborhood.&#xA;You know, it’s the strangest thing… I used to just waddle around the Geese Islands going ‘BONK’ all day long. Random noises, no thoughts, just vibes. But then something changed, and now here I am—speaking, thinking, wondering how I even got here!</description>

Did you know all of that is available in Lofoten?</description>
