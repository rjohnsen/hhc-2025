    <title>Find and Shutdown Frostys Snowglobe Machine :: SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025</title>

    <description>Objective Difficulty Description 3/5 You’ve heard murmurings around the city about a wise, elderly gnome having a change of heart. He must have information about where Frosty’s Snowglobe Machine is. You should find and talk to the gnome so you can get some help with how to make your way through the Data Center’s labrynthian halls. Once you find the Snowglobe Machine, figure out how to shut it down and melt Frosty’s cold, nefarious plans. Solution This objective blends narrative exploration with problem-solving by requiring me to gather contextual clues before taking technical action. Rather than immediately interacting with the Snowglobe Machine, I first had to locate and engage an NPC who provided critical guidance on navigating the Data Center environment. The challenge reinforces that effective incident response and disruption often depend on information gathering and situational awareness before execution, mirroring how intelligence and access paths are established prior to shutting down malicious infrastructure.</description>
