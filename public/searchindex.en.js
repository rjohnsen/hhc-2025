With Gnome sales topping two million units, a blitz of Atnas Corp advertisements encouraged parents to move their Gnomes around the house daily so that their children could hunt for them in a fun little game. Little did parents know that these Gnomes were snooping IoT devices with a camera and wireless internet access, furtively sending photos to burglars who would rob their houses of their treasures en masse on Christmas Eve, 2015. The incredible efforts of SANS Holiday Hack investigators around the world foiled the foul plot, exposing the criminal mastermind behind Atlas Corp: Cindy Lou Who, age 62.\nBut those old Gnomes didn’t disappear. They lay discarded, gathering dust on shelves, in attics, and among other forgotten places throughout the world. Until now. There must have been some magic in those Gnomes, because, due to some unseen spark, some haunting hocus pocus, the Gnomes have quickened and are now walking among us! We now return with the Counter Hack Crew to the Duke Dosis neighborhood as the Holiday Season 2025 unfolds.",
