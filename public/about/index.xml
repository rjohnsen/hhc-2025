    <link>http://localhost:1313/about/index.html</link>
    <description>Roger Johnsen is an information security professional with a strong focus on Blue Team operations, threat hunting, and detection engineering. His work centers on strengthening SOC capabilities through hypothesis-driven hunting, analyst education, and the development of tooling and processes that scale beyond individual investigations.&#xA;Roger is an active participant in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, with particular emphasis on technically demanding, long-form challenges such as the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge and platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. He approaches CTFs as controlled environments for validating techniques, stress-testing assumptions, and refining investigative workflows that directly translate into real-world security operations.</description>
