> Hi there, I'm Thomas, but you can call me CraHan if you like.

> What do you mean 'weird accent'? I have no idea why people keep telling me that, but it sounds fine in my head, to be honest.

> Anyway, way back before I joined Counter Hack, I was an avid HHC player just like you! Some of [my write-ups](https://n00.be/) even resulted in a couple of wins throughout the years. Definitely check them out if you're looking for some inspiration.

> If you decide to submit your own report, my [Holiday Hack Challenge report template](https://github.com/crahan/HolidayHackChallengeTemplate) might help you save some time as well.

> My t-shirt? You like it? Well, Synthwave, cyberpunk, and even cassette futurism are definitely my kinda jam!
>
> I also love to tinker, but for some weird reason my drawer of unfinished hacking projects just keeps overflowing. 24 hours in a day simply isn't enough time, I guess.

> Oh... and no matter what Mark or Kevin try to tell you, the Amiga is the absolute best retro computing platform ever made!

> The gnomes have been oddly suspicious and whispering to each other. In fact, I could've sworn I heard them use some sort of secret phrase. When I laughed right next to one, it said "passphrase denied". I asked what that was all about but it just giggled and ran away.
> 
> I know they've been using [GnomeTea](https://gnometea.web.app/login) to "spill the tea" on one another, but I can't sign up 'cause I'm obviously not a gnome. I could sure use your expertise to infiltrate this app and figure out what their secret passphrase is.

> I've tried a few things already, but as usual the whole... Uh, what's the word I'm looking for here? Oh right, "endeavor", ended up with the rest of my unfinished projects.
