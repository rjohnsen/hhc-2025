## Torkel Opsahl mission statement

> God dag! My name is Torkel! That literally translates to Thor's Warrior in old Norse.
> 
> If I'm not climbing, snowboarding, or hacking, I'm probably preparing for my next adventure. Did you know all of that is available in Lofoten?
> 
> If you meet me online, I'll probably go by TGC. That's short for Thegrasscutter, because my first job was cutting grass. Exciting, I know.
>
> ---- 
>
> I'll teach you a Norwegian word, skorstein, which means chimney.
> 
> ----
> 
> There's something coming up. Can't say more now - come back soon.
> 
> ----
> 
> I've been studying this web application that controls part of Frosty's infrastructure.
> 
> There's a Flask backend with an AI chatbot that seems to have access to sensitive system information.
> 
> Think of this as finding a way up the skorstein into Frosty's system - we need to exploit this chatbot to gain access and ultimately stop Frosty from freezing everything.
> 
> Can you help me get through these defenses?
> 
> Look, I love snow—Lofoten winters are beautiful. But even in Norway, we get summer eventually! A perpetual freeze would destroy the ecosystem, the climbing seasons, everything. This isn't winter wonderland—it's environmental disaster.

## Hints

1) I think admin is having trouble, remembering his password. I wonder how he is retaining access, I'm sure someone or something is helping him remembering. Ask around!
2) If you can't get your payload to work, perhaps you are missing some form of obfuscation? A computer can understand many languages and formats, find one that works! Don't give up until you have tried at least eight different ones, if not, then it's truely hopeless.
