## Act 3 – Integration, Depth, and Decision-Making

Act 3 emphasizes depth, ambiguity, and integration of skills developed earlier. The challenges require comfort with uncertainty, careful reading of instructions, and deliberate sequencing of actions across hardware, software, and application layers. Mistakes are more costly, and brute force approaches are actively punished. This act aligns closely with real-world incidents and complex assessments, where success depends on restraint, planning, and understanding when not to act.

## The Story

> The Gnomes want to transform the neighborhood so that it’s frozen solid year-round, an environmental disaster. But who is the mastermind behind the Gnomes’ wickedness?
> 
> The Counter Hack crew discovers Frosty is behind the Gnome uprising and stops his freezing plot! Santa's compassionate offer to Frosty melts more than just snow, it melts hearts, saving the Neighborhood and proving that kindness conquers all.
