## Objective

Difficulty: 4/5

Help Evan next to city hall hack this gnome and retrieve the temperature value reported by the I²C device at address 0x3C. The temperature data is XOR-encrypted, so you’ll need to work through each communication stage to uncover the necessary keys. Start with the unencrypted data being transmitted over the 1-wire protocol.
