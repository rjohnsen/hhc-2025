# Act 1 – Foundations and Observation

Act 1 focuses on establishing core mental models rather than exploiting edge cases. The challenges emphasize how systems communicate, how data moves across boundaries, and how small configuration details influence security outcomes. Difficulty remains low, but the act trains disciplined observation and protocol literacy rather than trial-and-error problem solving. This mirrors real-world security work where understanding normal behavior is a prerequisite for detecting abnormal or malicious activity.

## The Story

> The Counter Hack crew is in the Neighborhood festively preparing for the holidays when they are suddenly overrun by lively Gnomes in Your Home! There must have been some magic in those Gnomes, because, due to some unseen spark, some haunting hocus pocus, they have come to life and are now scurrying around the Neighborhood.
