## Jared Folkins mission statement

> Jared Folkins here! My favorite Christmas movie is White Christmas. You should find me on the socials and tell me what yours is.
> 
> You know, I think Santa is right! It truly is better to give than to receive.
> 
> I love singing Carols with my family! 🎵O holy night, the stars are brightly shining…🎵
> 
> Santa's got the right idea about giving, and I'm excited to give you a fantastic way to learn networking fundamentals!
> 
> This interactive visualization I've created shows you exactly how packets travel, how protocols work, and why networks behave the way they do.
> 
> It's way better than staring at boring textbooks - you can actually see what's happening!
> 
> Want to dive into some hands-on network exploration?

## Solution

This objective introduces a visual approach to understanding fundamental networking concepts. Rather than interacting with command-line tools or raw packet data, I am presented with an interactive model that illustrates how packets traverse a network, how protocols influence flow, and where state is maintained or transformed.

The purpose of this challenge is not to test technical proficiency, but to reinforce mental models that are essential for later analysis. By observing packet movement, protocol decisions, and network boundaries visually, I can more easily reason about behaviors that are otherwise abstract when viewed only through logs or command output.

This visualization serves as a conceptual foundation for subsequent challenges that rely on accurate interpretation of network traffic, service exposure, and control points within a networked environment.

This visualization allows me to observe the transition from a completed TLS handshake to an encrypted HTTPS request and response, reinforcing how transport security underpins application-layer communication.

## Jared Folkins closing words

After solving, Jared says:

> Wonderful! You've mastered those networking basics beautifully.
> 
> Now you can see how all the pieces of the network puzzle fit together - it's truly better to give knowledge than to keep it to yourself!
