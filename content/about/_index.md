**Roger Johnsen** is an information security professional with a strong focus on **Blue Team operations, threat hunting, and detection engineering**. His work centers on strengthening SOC capabilities through hypothesis-driven hunting, analyst education, and the development of tooling and processes that scale beyond individual investigations.

Roger is an active participant in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions, with particular emphasis on technically demanding, long-form challenges such as the **SANS Holiday Hack Challenge** and platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**. He approaches CTFs as controlled environments for validating techniques, stress-testing assumptions, and refining investigative workflows that directly translate into real-world security operations.

In the **SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2021**, Roger was recognized as **runner-up for Best Technical Answer**, earning a challenge coin for the depth, clarity, and technical rigor of his submission. He has consistently ranked near the top in subsequent editions, narrowly missing first place — a pattern that continues to fuel his yearly participation.

With a background in **systems development, programming, and security operations**, Roger emphasizes **technical correctness, reproducibility, and quality** over shortcuts or surface-level solutions.

## Predefender

**[Predefender](https://www.predefender.com/)**, founded by **Roger Johnsen**, is a professional initiative focused on advancing **practical, high-quality threat hunting**.

Its primary resource, the **[Predefender Threat Hunt Book](https://huntbook.predefender.com)**, functions as both a reference and a living knowledge base for SOC analysts and Blue Team practitioners. The material combines **Threat-Informed Defense**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and the **Lockheed Martin Kill Chain** with real investigative workflows, emphasizing documentation, reasoning, and reproducibility.

[Predefender](https://www.predefender.com/) deliberately bridges **detection engineering and programming**, reflecting the belief that effective threat hunting requires more than tooling alone. The goal is not only to detect malicious activity, but to **understand adversary behavior well enough to continuously improve defenses**.
