Upon completing the game I met the entire Counter Hack team over at the Grand Hotel:

Clicking Santa and he spilled the tea:

> Magnificent work, my friends! You've saved the Dosis Neighborhood from an eternal winter and stopped those mischievous Gnomes from causing any more trouble.
> 
> But Frosty... oh, Frosty. I understand your fear of melting, truly I do. The pain of fading away each spring, knowing you'll disappear until the next winter snow falls - that must be terribly lonely.
> 
> If only you had come to me! The North Pole never melts, Frosty. The snow is eternal there, the cold is constant. You could have lived with us year-round, never worrying about spring's warm sun again.
> 
> There's always been a place for you at the North Pole, my friend. You never had to resort to all this - the Gnomes, the refrigerator parts, the coolants, trying to freeze an entire neighborhood. All you had to do was ask.
> 
> The invitation still stands, Frosty. Come home with me to the North Pole. You'll never melt again, and we could always use another jolly soul spreading winter cheer.
> 
> What do you say, my friend?
> 
> Ho! Ho! Ho!

Even Frosty had something to say:

> Every spring, I melt away. Every year, I fade into nothing while the world moves on without me. But not this time... not anymore.
> 
> The magic in this old silk hat - the same magic that brought me to life - I discovered it could do so much more. It awakened the Gnomes, gave them purpose, gave them MY purpose.
> 
> Refrigerate the entire neighborhood, that's the plan. Keep it frozen, keep it cold. If winter never ends here, then neither do I. No more melting, no more disappearing, no more being forgotten until the next snowfall.
> 
> The Gnomes have been gathering coolants, refrigerator parts, everything we need. Soon the Dosis Neighborhood will be a frozen paradise - MY frozen paradise. And I'll finally be permanent, just like Santa, just like all the other holiday icons who don't have to fear the sun.
> 
> Santa... your kindness, offering me a home where I'd never melt... it's warming my frozen heart in a way I never expected. Oh... the warmth... I'm melting... Perhaps next winter... I'll come straight to the North Pole...
>
> Thank you, old friend...

And then the usual end credits screen! :)
